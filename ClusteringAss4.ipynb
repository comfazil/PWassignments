Unlike a regular confusion matrix, a pair confusion matrix only considers two classes at a time, rather than considering all possible combinations of classes. This allows for a more detailed analysis of the model's performance on the minority class."

The Silhouette Coefficient, for example, measures how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, and produces a score between -1 and 1, where higher scores indicate better clustering."

For example, if a model predicts the majority class for all instances in an imbalanced dataset, it may still achieve a high accuracy score even though it is not performing well on the minority class. To address this limitation, metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC can be used to provide a more detailed evaluation of the model's performance."
