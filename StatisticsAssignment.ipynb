Variance is a measure of how spread out the values in a dataset are from the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of variance and provides a measure of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. For example, if two datasets have the same mean but different standard deviations, the dataset with the larger standard deviation is more spread out."
