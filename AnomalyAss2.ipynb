By selecting only the most important features, we can reduce the noise and improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection algorithm.

Precision is the fraction of true positives among all the instances that are classified as positive. Recall is the fraction of true positives among all the actual positive instances. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Other metrics such as AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AUC-PR (area under the precision-recall curve) can also be used to evaluate the performance of anomaly detection algorithms."
