    "Boosting is a popular ensemble learning technique in machine learning that combines several weak learners to create a strong learner. The idea behind boosting is to iteratively train a series of weak models, where each model focuses on correctly classifying the samples that the previous models have misclassified. By combining these weak models, boosting algorithms are able to create a powerful ensemble model that is more accurate than any individual weak model."

As the number of estimators increases, the algorithm becomes more complex and more prone to overfitting the training data. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate number of estimators that balances the trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance. In practice, the optimal number of estimators can be determined using cross-validation techniques."
