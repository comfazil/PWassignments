    "Grid search with cross-validation (Grid Search CV) is a technique used in machine learning to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are parameters that cannot be learned from the data during the training process, and they need to be set prior to training the model. Grid Search CV automates the process of trying different combinations of hyperparameter values by systematically searching through a predefined grid of hyperparameter values and evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of Grid Search CV typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the hyperparameters and their respective values that you want to search over.\n",
    "- Define a performance metric (such as accuracy, F1 score, etc.) that you want to optimize.\n",
    "- Create a grid of all possible combinations of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "- For each combination of hyperparameter values, train the model using cross-validation, which involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on a subset of folds, and evaluating its performance on the remaining fold.\n",
    "- Calculate the performance metric for each combination of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "- Select the combination of hyperparameter values that resulted in the best performance metric as the optimal hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "- Grid Search CV helps in finding the best hyperparameter values that yield the best performance for a specific model, which can help improve the model's accuracy and generalization performance."

    "\n",
    "In Grid Search CV, all possible combinations of hyperparameter values from a predefined grid are exhaustively evaluated, resulting in a systematic search over the entire hyperparameter space. Grid Search CV is deterministic, meaning it will try every possible combination of hyperparameter values, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters or a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Randomized Search CV randomly samples a specified number of combinations of hyperparameter values from a predefined search space. Randomized Search CV is faster compared to Grid Search CV because it doesn't try all possible combinations of hyperparameter values. Instead, it randomly selects a subset of combinations, which can be advantageous when dealing with limited computational resources or when the hyperparameter space is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV depends on the specific use case and available resources. Grid Search CV is preferred when the hyperparameter space is small or when computational resources are not a concern. Randomized Search CV, on the other hand, may be preferred when dealing with large hyperparameter spaces or limited computational resources, as it can provide a good balance between exploration and computational efficiency."

Your dataset includes features such as income, credit score, loan amount, and employment status. During data preprocessing, you accidentally include the loan status (i.e., whether the loan was approved or not) as a feature in your training data. When training your model, it may learn to rely heavily on this leaked information, as the loan status is a direct indicator of credit risk. However, in a real-world scenario, the loan status would not be available at the time of prediction, leading to poor generalization performance and biased results."
