    "The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding is that Ordinal Encoding assigns integer values to categories based on their ordinal relationship, whereas Label Encoding assigns unique integer values to categories without considering their ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a dataset with a \"Size\" column with three categories: \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large.\" With Ordinal Encoding, these categories could be encoded as 0, 1, and 2 respectively, based on their ordinal relationship. However, with Label Encoding, these categories could be encoded as 0, 1, and 2 randomly, without considering their ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose Ordinal Encoding when the categories have a meaningful ordinal relationship, such as when dealing with rankings or levels. For example, in a dataset with education levels (\"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" \"PhD\"), where the levels have a clear ordinal relationship, Ordinal Encoding could be used. On the other hand, you might choose Label Encoding when the categories do not have any meaningful ordinal relationship and need to be encoded as distinct categories."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are encoded based on the mean of the target variable for each category. This technique can be used when the target variable is a binary or multi-class variable and there is a correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a binary classification problem where the target variable is \"Churn\" (0 or 1), indicating whether a customer has churned or not. We have a categorical variable \"City\" with categories \"New York,\" \"Los Angeles,\" and \"Chicago.\" We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode these categories based on the mean of the \"Churn\" variable for each city category. The encoding could be as follows:\n",

    "New York: 0.25\n",
    "Los Angeles: 0.10\n",
    "Chicago: 0.05\n",

Higher mean values would indicate a higher likelihood of churn, and lower mean values would indicate a lower likelihood of churn. This encoding can capture the correlation between the city and churn, and can potentially improve the performance of the machine learning model."
