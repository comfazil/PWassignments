For example, if we wanted to estimate the mean height of all high school students in a city, a smaller sample size would result in a larger margin of error.

Let's assume that the null hypothesis is that the mean weight loss for participants on the drug is not significantly different from zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean weight loss is significantly different from zero. We can use a two-tailed t-test since the alternative hypothesis is not directional.
