    "Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters by recursively splitting or merging them based on their similarity. Unlike other clustering techniques, such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance. Instead, it produces a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that illustrates the nested relationships between the clusters.\n",

    "The two main types of hierarchical clustering algorithms are agglomerative and divisive clustering. Agglomerative clustering starts with each observation as a separate cluster and then successively merges the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster remains. Divisive clustering, on the other hand, starts with all observations in a single cluster and then recursively splits it into smaller clusters until each observation is in its own cluster. Agglomerative clustering is more commonly used and easier to implement."
