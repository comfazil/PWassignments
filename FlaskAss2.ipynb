The data sent with a GET request is sent as part of the URL itself, in the form of query parameters. These parameters are visible in the address bar of the user's browser, and they can be bookmarked or shared with others.\n",

    "The POST method, on the other hand, is used to submit data to a server. When a user fills out a form on a website and submits it, a POST request is sent to the server with the form data in the body of the request. Unlike a GET request, the data sent with a POST request is not visible in the URL, which can be useful for sending sensitive information.\n",
