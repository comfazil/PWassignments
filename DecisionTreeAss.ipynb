    "The decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by partitioning the feature space into a set of rectangular regions, each corresponding to a leaf node in the decision tree. The algorithm starts by selecting the feature that provides the best split, i.e., the feature that maximizes the separation between the classes. It then recursively splits the data based on the selected feature until all data points in a given region belong to the same class. The resulting tree can be used to make predictions on new data points by traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the feature values of the data point."
