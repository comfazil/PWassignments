    "Resource sharing: By allowing threads to share resources like memory and CPU time, multithreading can help programmes utilise less resources overall.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Due to the need to manage thread synchronisation, thread safety, and potential race situations, multithreaded systems can be more complex than single-threaded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased memory usage: Because each thread has its own stack and memory allocation, programmes may use more memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIL: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the performance advantages of multithreading in some circumstances by preventing concurrent execution of Python code.\n",

    "Deadlock: A deadlock is a condition in which two or more threads are stalled while awaiting the release of a resource, creating a loop of waiting. When a resource is held by one thread and requested by another thread that is also holding the resource the first thread needs, a deadlock might result. As a result, neither thread is able to proceed, and the programme becomes trapped in a stalemate.\n",

    "Race Conditions: When a program's output depends on the order in which its threads are scheduled to run, a race condition has occurred. In other words, the time and order of thread execution affect the outcome. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads access and modify the same shared resource simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable or incorrect results."
