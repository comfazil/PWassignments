    "Data collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation are all topics that fall under the purview of statistics, a subfield of mathematics. It entails using mathematical techniques and tools to extrapolate results from data and come to wise judgements. Several professions, including science, engineering, the social sciences, commerce, and government, employ statistics. Providing unbiased and accurate data that can be used to make decisions and find solutions is statistics' main mission. Probability, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and sampling theory are a few important statistics concepts."

    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves the collection, analysis, and presentation of data in a way that summarizes or describes its main features. It provides a summary of data that can be easily understood and used to draw conclusions. For example, descriptive statistics might be used in market research to describe the characteristics of a target audience or in medical research to describe the characteristics of a patient population.\n",

It is used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and estimate population parameters. For example, Inferential statistics might be used in political polling to make predictions about election outcomes or in quality control to test whether a product meets certain standards."

A more appropriate statistical analysis would be to calculate the percentage of students who received each grade and present the results using a bar graph."
