    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to the seasonal patterns in a time series that vary over time. Unlike fixed seasonal patterns, where the seasonal fluctuations remain consistent across different time periods, time-dependent seasonal components indicate that the strength or shape of the seasonal effect changes over time. This implies that the seasonality in the data is not constant but evolves or varies as time progresses.\n",

    "Identifying time-dependent seasonal components requires analyzing the data to observe variations in the seasonal patterns over time. This can be done by visual inspection of the data through line plots or seasonal subseries plots, where the data is divided into separate plots based on each season or time period. Additionally, statistical techniques like decomposition methods (e.g., STL decomposition) or time series models that capture time-varying seasonality (e.g., state space models) can help identify and estimate time-dependent seasonal components."

    "Autoregression (AR) models are used in time series analysis and forecasting to capture the relationship between an observation and a specified number of lagged observations. An AR model predicts the current value of a time series based on its past values. It uses a linear combination of the lagged observations, weighted by coefficients, to estimate the current value. AR models are suitable for data exhibiting autocorrelation, where the value of a variable depends on its past values."
