    " The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that selects features based on their statistical properties. It works by assigning a score to each feature based on some statistical measure, such as correlation or mutual information, and then selecting the top-ranked features. The idea is to filter out irrelevant or redundant features before training a model, which can improve model performance and reduce training time."

This makes the Wrapper method more computationally expensive than the Filter method but can result in better feature subsets."
